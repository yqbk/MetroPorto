## Keyboard control
Keys `1,2,3,4,5` are responsible for switching on/off known photos of specific user. From the beginning every user is "on".

Example: pushing `1` turns off "User 1" - his emoji is bad. Next pushing the same key `1` turns on "User 1" - his emoji is good. And so on...


### Run sript:
```python3 face.py```

options:
- use neutral face `python3 face.py neutral`
